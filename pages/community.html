<p>Ventura Law was founded with the fundamental desire to provide legal services characterized by extraordinary compassion, personal attention, and support for our community.</p>
<p>Extending that mission beyond legal services, Ventura Law supports numerous local and national non-profit organizations, including Ann’s Place, End Distracted Driving, Women’s Center of Danbury, Veterati, the Celma Masty Ovarian Cancer Foundation and Big Brothers and Big Sisters.</p>
<p>We also encourage firm personnel to support their local communities by participating in firm-sponsored service opportunities in our community. Firm-sponsored service projects, coordinated by a volunteer led Community Service Steering Group, allow Ventura Law personnel to donate time toward a range of meaningful, hands-on volunteer activities. Many of our lawyers and professionals serve on the boards of directors of area nonprofit organizations.</p>
<h5 class="inner-section-title">We seek to focus our support on:</h5>
<ul>
<li>Large community-based events or programs; i.e. events which promote health and safety awareness, cultural events, family friendly festivals</li>
<li>Educational programs, mentor programs, and career development in the legal field</li>
<li>Key centers of influence, affinity membership groups, and non-profit organizations that support our local ethnic communities</li>
</ul>
